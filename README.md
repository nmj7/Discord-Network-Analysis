# Discord-Network-Analysis
## Introduction  
Discord is a widely used platform that facilitates communication among various communities, particularly in the gaming space. With its rich text-based interaction, it offers a valuable dataset that can be mined to understand user behavior and community dynamics.  
This project focuses on analyzing a Discord server’s text data to:

- Visualize the communication network  
- Calculate centrality and betweenness measures  
- Extract insights about user interactions  

## Methodology  
The analysis pipeline includes the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Retrieve message data from the Discord server using a bot via the Discord API.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean the text data, remove stop words, and tokenize the content.  
3. **Matrix Construction**: Create a co-occurrence matrix representing user interaction frequencies.  
4. **Network Building**: Generate a graph from the matrix and visualize it using NetworkX.  
5. **Metric Calculation**: Compute centrality and betweenness to identify key users in the network.  
6. **Insight Extraction**: Analyze the graph to draw conclusions about community structure and behavior.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**  
- **Discord API**  
- [`discord.py`](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) – For API access  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NLTK** – Natural language processing  
- **NetworkX** – Graph creation and analysis  

## Results and Discussion  
Outcomes will vary depending on the server and dataset analyzed. The primary objective is to offer a framework for examining Discord-based communication networks, revealing patterns of interaction and identifying influential participants.
